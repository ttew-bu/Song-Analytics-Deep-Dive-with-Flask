<h2>
    Models were used in the creation of this project and its dataset?
</h2>
<ul style="line-height:150%; color:white;list-style-type: none;background-color:#358597;">
    <li>
        For the unsupervised portion of the pre-work, I used a Multicore Latent Diralecht Allocation (from Gensim) to generate the labels for the dataset based on the raw list of genres sent by Spotify. There should not be too much change to this model in future iterations. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        For the lyric predictor model, I used a Linear Support Vectorizor Classification Model (LinearSVC from Sci-kit Learn) to process the vectorized lyrics. The current model has about a 71% accuracy with 5 classes being identified. The intent is to re-run this model with balanced classes to increase accuracies with the intrduction of new classes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        For the attribute-based model, I used a Random Forest Classifier (and a scaler from when the model was built in Jupyter). The current model has about a 69% accuracy with 8 classes being identified. Unlike with the lyrics, I had enough data to use 1,000 songs from each class to train/test the model. 
    </li>

    <li>
        To do sentiment analysis, I used a Vanilla VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer on both the individual words for the polarity overlays and the whole song for the outputs
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        I also used a logistic regression, knn, and a dummy classifier (as a baseline) when experimenting to find the ideal model and measure performance across hyperparameters.
    </li>
