                <h3>What does this chart say?</h3>
                <p>
                    This chart compares your favorite song to the 40,000 song sample used to train some of the models. 
                    The songs spanned 50 years and all genres, so this addresses how this song compares to all songs. 
                    Future updates to this project could include slicers that will help you compare your song to those with specific genres or attributes. 
                    All values are normalized and scaled 0-1 so this visualization came across cleanly. 
                    The boxplot for the sample highlights the 25th and 75th percentiles on top of the mean. 
                    The whiskers go up to the top of the sample to highlight the size of the top and bottom quarters of that attribute.
                    The blue overlay is your favorite song's attribute in that category.
                    
                    <h3>Some questions for you to ask include: </h3>
                    <h5>Does my song fall outside a certain range for an attribute compared to the sample?</h5>
                    <h5>I think this song is really loud, but is it really loud compared to the sample?</h5>
                    <h5>What is unique about my favorite song from a song characteristic perspective?</h5>
