# Song-Analytics-Deep-Dive-with-Flask
This web application allows you to take a look at your favorite songs in different ways than you may have before. 
By bringing some basic visualization (via plotly) and machine learning (VADER, NLP, and SKLearn) together, I hope that you can learn something new about your favorite song.
The skills I built out making this include NLTK, SKlearn, calling APIs (via packages in Python), data manipulation data visualiztion, and NLP.

I hope that you can learn something about your favorite song by looking at this.
The visualization page will tell you about the characteristics of the song (and the Spotify documentation can help you understand what each characteristic means)

The other analysis page will run a sentiment analysis of the lyrics and try to predict the genres based on various characteristics.

Any feedback on methodologies or features would be appreciated!
